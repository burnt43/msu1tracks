        %p
          The purpose of this site is to store videogame music that I have converted to be able to play on a SNES or a SNES Emulator using the MSU-1 feature. Right now, I only have Legacy of the Wizard, an old NES game I had, converted to MSU-1 PCMs. I have a
          %a{href: "https://github.com/burnt43/msu1tracks/issues/2"} feature
          in the works that you can take an MSU-1 patch and mix and match whatever song in that game to a file I have hosted on this site. This means you'll be able to map the Light World song from Link to the Past to a song from Videogame A and then you can map the Dark World song to some song from Videogame B. You'll be able to create MSU-1 packs on the fly.
